FileSaver.js
============

FileSaver.js implements the HTML5 W3C `saveAs()` FileSaver interface in browsers that do
not natively support it. There is a [FileSaver.js demo][1] that demonstrates saving
various media types.

FileSaver.js is the solution to saving files on the client-side, and is perfect for
webapps that need to generate files, or for saving sensitive information that shouldn't be
sent to an external server.

Looking for `canvas.toBlob()` for saving canvases? Check out
[canvas-toBlob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/canvas-toBlob.js) for a cross-browser implementation.

Supported Browsers
------------------

| Browser        | Constructs as | Filenames    | Max Blob Size | Dependencies |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Firefox 20+    | Blob          | Yes          | 800 MiB       | None         |
| Firefox < 20   | data: URI     | No           | n/a           | [Blob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js) |
| Chrome         | Blob          | Yes          | 345 MiB       | None         |
| Chrome for Android | Blob      | Yes          | ?             | None         |
| IE 9-          | text          | Yes          | n/a           | None         |
| IE 10+         | Blob          | Yes          | 600 MiB       | None         |
| Opera 15+      | Blob          | Yes          | 345 MiB       | None         |
| Opera < 15     | data: URI     | No           | n/a           | [Blob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js) |
| Safari 6.1+*   | Blob          | No           | ?             | None         |
| Safari < 6     | data: URI     | No           | n/a           | [Blob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js) |

Feature detection is possible:

```js
try {
    var isFileSaverSupported = !!new Blob;
} catch (e) {}
```

### IE < 10

Below example will show you how to save HTML documents or text file in IE < 10 without Flash-based
polyfills. Actually, this function also works for HTML5 supported browsers.
```js
boolean saveTextAs(in textContent, in fileName, in charset)
```

### Safari 6.1+

Blobs may be opened instead of saved sometimes—you may have to direct your Safari users to manually
press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to save the file after it is opened. Further information is available
[on the issue tracker](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/issues/12).

Syntax
------

```js
FileSaver saveAs(in Blob data, in DOMString filename)
```

Examples
--------

### Saving text(All Browsers)

```js
saveTextAs("Hi,This,is,a,CSV,File", "test.csv");
```

Please note for IE 9-, available file extensions are htm/html/txt, any other text based file will be appended with .txt file extension automatically.

### Saving text(HTML 5)

```js
var blob = new Blob(["Hello, world!"], {type: "text/plain;charset=utf-8"});
saveAs(blob, "hello world.txt");
```

The standard W3C File API [`Blob`][3] interface is not available in all browsers.
[Blob.js][4] is a cross-browser `Blob` implementation that solves this.

### Saving a canvas

```js
var canvas = document.getElementById("my-canvas"), ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
// draw to canvas...
canvas.toBlob(function(blob) {
    saveAs(blob, "pretty image.png");
});
```

Note: The standard HTML5 `canvas.toBlob()` method is not available in all browsers.
[canvas-toBlob.js][5] is a cross-browser `canvas.toBlob()` that polyfills this.
